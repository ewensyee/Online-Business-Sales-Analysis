# Online-Business-Sales-Analysis

## Project Background
This project is about the analysis of the sales performance of an online retail business from 2017 to 2019. The dataset contains details recorded for sales transactions with the gross sales, discounts, returns, shipping costs, and product category metrics. The purpose of this analysis is to observe trends, generate actionable insights, and provide data-driven recommendations to help in improving the performance of business across sales, marketing, and operations. Through the observation of the trends in sales growth, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, the specific aim of this project is to enable the business to capitalize on its best strategies towards social and sustainable growth in a competitive online business environment.

## Executive Summary
The online business sales analysis from 2017 to 2019 shows a steady growth in total orders and gross sales, where performance peaks in November and December. However, findings reveal that although categories such as Basket and Art & Sculpture have the highest sales, it also experiences the highest returns which impacted the profit margins. Shipping costs also increased by 19% over the years. High performing categories like Jewelry and Kitchen showed low returns while niche categories had zero returns. To mitigate revenue loss and improve business performance, we recommend implementing data-driven quality control, optimise discount strategies, focus on high-performing categories and utilise data visualisation tools to track key trends, will strengthen their position in the online business and drive sustainable growth.
